# Notes

Short write-ups of patterns, observations, and lessons learned from working with AI.

## How to add a note

Create a new file in this directory. Use a descriptive filename (e.g., `when-to-restart-a-conversation.md`).

Each note should be concise and include:
- The context or situation
- What happened or what was observed
- The takeaway
