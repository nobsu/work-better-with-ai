# Give AI enough context

The most common reason AI gives a bad answer is missing context.

Before asking, briefly describe:
- What you're trying to accomplish
- What constraints apply
- What you've already tried (if relevant)

A few extra sentences upfront usually saves several rounds of back-and-forth.

## Example
Instead of: "How do I fix this error?"
Try: "I'm building a Node.js API. I'm getting a 'Cannot read properties of undefined' error when calling getUserById(). The user object comes from a database query. Here's the relevant code: ..."

## When it matters most
- Debugging (include the full error and surrounding code)
- Architecture decisions (include existing stack and constraints)
- Writing tasks (include audience, tone, and purpose)
