# work-better-with-ai

Personal notes and practical prompts for working better with AI.

## About

This repo is a collection of things I've learned while using AI in real work.

- Some are prompts that consistently help.
- Some are small patterns that reduce friction.
- Some are lessons from mistakes.

If it's here, it was useful enough to keep.

## What's Inside

| Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| [`notes/`](notes/) | Short write-ups of patterns, observations, and lessons learned |
| [`prompts/`](prompts/) | Copy-ready templates I actually use |
| [`checklists/`](checklists/) | Simple safeguards before shipping something generated by AI |

## How to Use

1. Browse by topic.
2. Copy what's useful.
3. Adapt to your context.

There's no grand framework here — just accumulated experience.

## Philosophy

- Keep entries short
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Document what worked, and why
- Record edge cases and failure modes
