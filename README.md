# work-better-with-ai

Personal notes and practical prompts for working better with AI.

## About
This repo is a collection of things I've learned while using AI in real work.

Some are prompts that consistently help.
Some are small patterns that reduce friction.
Some are lessons from mistakes.

If it's here, it was useful enough for me to keep.

## What's inside
- Notes: short write-ups of patterns and observations
- Prompts: copy-ready templates I actually use
- Checklists: simple safeguards before shipping something generated by AI

## How to use
Browse by topic.
Copy what's useful.
Adapt to your context.

There's no grand framework here — just accumulated experience.

## Structure
- `notes/` context and lessons
- `prompts/` reusable templates
- `checklists/` quality control reminders

## Philosophy
- Keep entries short
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Document what worked, and why
- Record edge cases and failure modes
