# Prompt: Ask for a code review

Use this when you want AI to review code critically rather than just validate it.

---

Review this code as if you were a senior engineer on my team. Look for:
- Logic errors or edge cases I may have missed
- Security issues
- Performance concerns
- Readability and maintainability problems
- Places where I'm reinventing something that already exists

Be direct. If something is wrong, say so clearly.

## Notes
- Works well for pull request reviews before merging
- Add "focus on [X]" to narrow the review
- Follow up with "What would you change first?" to prioritize feedback
