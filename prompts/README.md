# Prompts

Copy-ready templates for common AI interactions.

## How to add a prompt

Create a new file in this directory. Use a descriptive filename (e.g., `idea-stress-test.md`).

Each prompt should include:
- A brief description of when to use it
- The prompt template itself (in a code block for easy copying)
- Any notes on what makes it effective
