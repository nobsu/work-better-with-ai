# Prompt: Explain unfamiliar code

Use this when you inherit code or encounter something you don't understand.

---

Explain what this code does, line by line if needed. Assume I'm familiar with programming but not this specific codebase or library.

Tell me:
1. What problem it solves
2. How it works at a high level
3. Any non-obvious parts I should pay attention to

[paste code here]

## Notes
- Useful for onboarding to a new codebase
- Follow up with "What could go wrong with this?" to surface risks
- Add "in plain English" if the explanation is too technical
