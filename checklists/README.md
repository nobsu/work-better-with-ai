# Checklists

Simple safeguards to run through before shipping something generated by AI.

## How to add a checklist

Create a new file in this directory. Use a descriptive filename (e.g., `before-shipping-ai-code.md`).

Keep each checklist:
- Short enough to actually use
- Specific enough to catch real problems
- General enough to apply across projects
